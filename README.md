Open exchange format for storing material parameters of textile structures for drape simulations

This repository consists of example file and python code for dealing saving the fabrics drape data  open exchange format for storing material parameters of textile structures for drape simulations.
The background for the format creation is explained in the paper "Material description for textile draping simulation: data structure, open data exchange formats and system for
automatic analysis of experimental series", published in Textile Research Journal DOI: 10.1177/00405175211061192

The repository consists of subfolder for examples (samples), python code for writing and reading data, example of extracted files.
